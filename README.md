# Tech Warm-Up: The One Arm AI Slot Machine Experiment
## CSE110 Spring 2026 — Team Potatoes

---

## Experiment Overview

This is a controlled experiment measuring the consistency and variation in outputs from **OpenAI's GPT-5.4** when given identical prompts under clean session conditions.

**Primary Research Question:**  
How much variation, drift, and quality spread do we see when the same prompt is run 50 times in clean sessions, and what does a tightly constrained refinement process buy us?

---

## Setup & Parameters

### Chosen AI Coding Assistant
- **Tool:** OpenAI Codex
- **Model:** `gpt-5.4`
- **This must be the same across all 50 baseline runs and all refinement rounds**

### Harness / Execution Method
- **How we run GPT-5.4:** Fresh session via OpenAI interface
- **Session management:** Fresh session for each run (no context carryover, no memory)
- **Input prompt file:** `prompts/original-prompt.txt`
- **Metrics captured:** See "Data Collection" section below

### Team Information
- **Team Name:** Potatoes
- **Team Members:** Yuting Duan, Arav Vyawahare, Kelly Dempster, Diana Kostina, Siddharth Sivalanka, Bekzhan Yessengeldy, Arjun Singh, Ethan Pham, Ray Wang, Ryan Lee, Zihan Zhang, Tangjian Shi
- **Work Division:** 12 people total; pairs of 2-3 people, 5 runs per person (10 runs per pair)

---

## Ground Rules (From Assignment)

✓ **One Prompt Rule:** Use `original-prompt.txt` verbatim for all 50 runs. No variations.

✓ **Consistent Model:** Same model (gpt-5.4) for all runs.

✓ **Clean Sessions:** Fresh session for each run. No context carryover or memory.

✓ **No Hand-Editing:** Capture code as-is. Bugs are data.

✓ **Full Repository:** Each run in `step1/candidate-001/`, `step1/candidate-002/`, etc.

## Team Calibration Step

Before Phase 2, the team will run one shared test execution of the prompt to:
- Ensure consistent use of clean sessions
- Align scoring using the rubric
- Confirm repository structure and workflow

This run is not included in the 50 baseline runs.

## Data Collection

For every run, capture:

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
| Run ID | e.g., `candidate-001` |
| Timestamp | ISO 8601 format |
| Model Version | `gpt-5.4` |
| Input Tokens | From GPT response |
| Output Tokens | From GPT response |
| Total Tokens | Input + Output |
| Wall-Clock Time (s) | Stopwatch |
| Tool-Reported Time (s) | If available from interface |
| Files Produced | List (e.g., "index.html, style.css, script.js") |
| Lines of Code | Total lines across all files |
| Runs in Browser? | Yes / No / Partial |
| App Quality Notes | 1-2 sentences |
| Code Quality Notes | 1-2 sentences |

**Definitions:**
- Yes = Runs with no errors and interactive  
- Partial = Loads but has broken functionality  
- No = Does not load or crashes   

**Format:** Use `data-capture-template.csv` in the root directory.

## Key Constraints

1. **Prompt is frozen:** No variations across all 50 runs
2. **Same model:** `gpt-5.4` for all runs
3. **Clean sessions:** No context carryover between runs
4. **No editing:** Save code as-is
5. **Refinement is one-shot:** No iterative loops, max 200 words per refinement prompt
